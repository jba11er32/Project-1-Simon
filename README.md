User Stories
As a player, I want to play a game of Simon that tests my memory compared to others.

MVP Goals
-A functional playing game that has a start(play again) button that allows the player to start the game. When the game starts we want the player to be able to test their memory by clicking a certain number of colors that appears on the screen/page. Once the player fails, a score will show for their current game and the past scores as well.

Stretch Goals
Bronze: Present a scoreboard with the highest scores on the website.
Silver: When a new high score is achieved, we congratulate the user.
Gold: Allow the player to choose between slow normal or fast speeds to play from.
