Project Description
The player tests their memory by remembering the order at which each color flashes. As the player correctly inputs the order, the length of the memory test increases.

User Stories
As a player, I want to play a game of Simon that tests my memory compared to others.

MVP Goals
-A functional playing game that has a start(play again) button that allows the player to start the game. When the game starts we want the player to be able to test their memory by clicking a certain number of colors that appears on the screen/page. Once the player fails, a score will show for their current game and the past scores as well.

Stretch Goals
Bronze: Increase the speed of the light up animations over time.
Silver: When a new high score is achieved, we congratulate the user.
Gold: Allow the player to choose between slow normal or fast speeds to play from.
